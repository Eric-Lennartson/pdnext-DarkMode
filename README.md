# pdnext-DarkMode
Dark mode for the pdnext fork of puredata. We can all avoid burning out our eye sockets together.

This is just the colors from the vscode theme I use.

This repo is probably overkill, but should make it easy for people to find and check out.
It could be cool to have this repo become a hub for many different pdnext themes, if that's ever a thing.

In the future, maybe pdnext will allow for you to choose between themes?
